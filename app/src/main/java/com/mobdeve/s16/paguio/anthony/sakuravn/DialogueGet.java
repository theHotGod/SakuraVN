        dialogues.add(new Dialogue("Speaker 2", "Alright. I need to tell you a secret. Have you ever had a moment in life wherein your senses failed to live up to your expectations? Something you were so sure about but it just wasn't so?"));

        dialogues.add(new Dialogue("Speaker 2", "I can still feel what you're feeling at the moment. Here, let me just explain it this way. Remember what Seneca said about we often suffer in imagination more than in reality? Or the fact that Einstein said that imagination is more important than knowledge?"));

        dialogues.add(new Dialogue("Speaker 2", "That's a good guess. But I think it's more than that. I think it's about how we should trust our imagination more than our senses. Because our senses can be deceiving."));
        dialogues.add(new Dialogue("Speaker 2", "Well, here's the thing. We often imagine ourselves in negative scenario after negative scenario, thinking it is all real. But whenever we think of something positive, we don't credit it reality. See the pattern?"));
        dialogues.add(new Dialogue("Speaker 2", "We often disregard positivity in our lives due to believing torturing \"self\" is most beneficial for us to live amongst people, but it doesn't have to be that way."));
        dialogues.add(new Dialogue("You", "I think I understand now. But how does this all relate to the world being a mere reflection of self?"));
        dialogues.add(new Dialogue("Speaker 2", "I'm glad you asked. You see, the world is just a mere reflection of self. It is a reflection of how we see ourselves. If we see ourselves as a failure, then the world will be a failure. If we see ourselves as a success, then the world will be a success."));
